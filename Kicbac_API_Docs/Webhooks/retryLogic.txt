Retry Logic
If we try to deliver a webhook notification to your endpoint and do not get an HTTP 200 response, the gateway will reattempt delivery up to 20 times. Over the course of 3 days we will keep trying until a success response is received. If no success response is received in this time period the notification will stop attempting and will not be delivered.

The approximate interval between delivery retires is currently:

1 attempt 15 seconds after the initial attempt
3 attempts every 60 seconds
1 attempt 5 minutes later
1 attempt 15 minutes later
1 attempt 30 minutes later
10 attempts every hour
2 attempts every 12 hours
1 final attempt after 24 more hours
Your application should not rely on this specific retry schedule, as the retry timing may change in the future.

The retry schedule may also change based on current circumstances. For example, if there are a large number of pending notifications for your endpoint, we may significantly reduce the number of retry attempts for that endpoint until the backlog is cleared.
